# Project Title: The Impact of Natural Disasters on U.S. Real Estate Prices

## Project Description
This project analyzes how natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires affect real estate prices in impacted regions across the U.S. The goal is to provide insights into the economic impact of these events, which can inform policy-making, urban planning, and investment strategies.

## Data Sources
- **NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)**
  - Data on natural disasters in the U.S.
  - Website: [NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)
  - Specific Datasets: 1.NOAA's Storm Events Database:(https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp)

- **Federal Housing Finance Agency**
  - Data on U.S. housing prices and related statistics.
  - Website: [Federal Housing Finance Agency](https://www.fhfa.gov/)
